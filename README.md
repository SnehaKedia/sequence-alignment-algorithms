# Sequence  Alignment Algorithms
Implemented two different algorithms for Optimal Sequence Alignment namely Needlemanâ€“Wunsch Algorithm and Hirschberg's Algorithm.
This project was done as a part of CSCI 570 Analysis of Algorithms course at USC Fall 2021.


Note: Algorithms are provided in chapter 6 of the Kleinberg textbook.
